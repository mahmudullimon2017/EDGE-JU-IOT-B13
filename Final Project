Agriculture is one of the most vital sectors worldwide, and efficient water management is essential for maximizing crop yield while minimizing water wastage. Traditional irrigation methods often lead to overwatering or underwatering, harming crops and depleting water resources. With advancements in IoT (Internet of Things), smart irrigation systems offer a solution by automating the process based on real-time data.
This project proposes developing an IoT-based smart irrigation system that utilizes soil moisture sensors to monitor soil conditions, automate water pump control, and display real-time data on the Blynk platform for efficient water usage and remote monitoring
